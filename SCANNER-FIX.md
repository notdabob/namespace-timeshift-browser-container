# Network Scanner Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Scanner was exiting after single run**
   - Changed to continuous operation with 5-minute intervals
   - Scanner now runs indefinitely within the container

2. **Missing data file initialization**
   - Added `init-data.py` to create initial JSON files
   - Updated `start.sh` to run initialization script
   - Ensures both `discovered_servers.json` and legacy files exist

3. **JavaScript error handling**
   - Added better error checking for non-JSON responses
   - Handle cases where data files don't exist yet
   - Improved error messages in the UI

4. **Supervisor configuration**
   - Added retry settings for scanner process
   - Added log rotation to prevent disk filling

5. **Data directory initialization**
   - Scanner now creates data directory if missing
   - Better error logging for file operations

## Deployment Steps

To apply these fixes:

```bash
# SSH to Proxmox
ssh root@your-proxmox-host

# Navigate to project
cd namespace-timeshift-browser-container

# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Update the container
./deploy-proxmox.sh update
```

## Debugging

If issues persist, run the debug script:

```bash
./debug-scanner.sh
```

This will show:
- Container status
- Service status
- Scanner logs
- Data file status
- Network detection test
- Python module availability
- API status

## Manual Testing

Test the scanner manually inside the container:

```bash
# Enter container
docker exec -it idrac-manager bash

# Test scanner
python3 /app/src/network-scanner.py

# Check logs
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/scanner.log
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/scanner_error.log
```

## Expected Behavior

After deployment:
1. Scanner should start automatically
2. Initial scan should run immediately
3. Subsequent scans every 5 minutes
4. Dashboard should show discovered servers
5. Custom range scanning should work without errors
